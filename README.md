##  About the project
This is a clone of the offcial Uber website. Disclaimer: this is a project for learning purposes and will not be used for
commercial usage nor to gain personal benefits. This is my very first clone project, I didn not follow any tutorial, it's
100% a personal project done by me.

## Challenges faced while working on the projects:

One of the challenges I faced was the navbar. I've never done a navbar with a drop menu. I tackled this by making a container that
was positioned relatively and the drop list was positioned absolutely. Once the container is clicked on, the drop list will
show right below the navbar.

Another challenges I faced was first section of the landing page, where clicking on each Uber service, changes the background image
of the wrapper container in the big screen. I solved this problem by changing the link in Javascript once a service tap is clicked 
upon but also to made the inner div has an index of 2, so it will always stay on top and not inherit the background image of the div parent.
